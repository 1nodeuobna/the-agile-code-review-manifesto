## Tips and Tricks for Using the PCsensor FS3-P USB Footswitch
 
The PCsensor FS3-P USB footswitch is a versatile device that can be used for various purposes. Here are some tips and tricks to make the most out of it:

- You can assign different functions to each pedal depending on which application you are using.
