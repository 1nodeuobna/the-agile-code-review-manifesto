# The Agile Code Review Manifesto

This manifesto collects 10 practices of how to conduce a code review using an agile approach.
It seeks to have better analysis in what was developed, to share better understanding of requirements and
keep people close and working together as a team.

It is based on Agile Manifesto along with my experience as software developer on agile teams.

The described practices here are not rules and represents particular a point o view as a opinion of how to approach
the code review activity. Some practices might work or not for you situation. Consider to adapt accondingly with you needs.
